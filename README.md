# CITS5505 Group Project â€“ The Richverse

This project is built using Flask and provides an interactive dashboard to visualize portfolio returns, benchmarks, and performance metrics.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python **3.10** or higher (due to modern type hinting syntax). However, python **3.13** is currently not recommended due to compatibility issues with certain dependencies (e.g., setuptools, pkgutil, and others).
- `pip` (latest recommended)
- Virtual environment setup (`venv`)
